/**
 * Integration tests for the plugin bus (Go binary path).
 *
 * These tests start the real Go bus binary and test the full HTTP+WebSocket path.
 *
 * NOTE: The MemoryBus fallback (in-memory EventBus) is tested IMPLICITLY
 * whenever BusClient.connect() or BusTui.connect() is called without the
 * Go binary available. Both connect() methods log a warning and transparently
 * fall back to MemoryBusClient / MemoryBusTui. There is no dedicated test
 * file — the fallback is exercised by any plugin code that runs without the
 * bus binary in PATH.
